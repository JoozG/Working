"FASTA_processing" is a private project aimed at developed into a fully functional python library.

# Status as of December 9, 2024 #

The project currently includes five modules, one of which is redundant and likely to be removed soon. While the project has just been made public, progress and updates are actively being documented in real time.

## Available Modules

Currently, four modules are functional:
   ### Three modules are designed to process input in the form of strings representing different biomolecules:
   ####1. Deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA)
   ####2. Ribonucleic acids (RNA)
   ####3. Proteins
    
   ### The fourth module handles input directly from files in the FASTA format.

Planned Enhancements   |

At present, the example use cases do not demonstrate the ability to analyze data directly from files. This feature represents the next milestone for the project.
